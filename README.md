### Hi there! 👋 I'm Fahad

I'm a backend developer who loves building robust systems, fun side projects, and tools that solve real problems.

**🚀 My tech stack**  

I specialize in backend engineering, recently completed the **Boot.dev** backend curriculum with full knowledge and understanding of:
* **Go (Golang):** For concurrency, high-performance services, and CLI tools.
* **Python:** High level language for fast scripting and automation.
* **C:** For raw performance and low level control with minimum overhead.
* **C++:** For object oriented based programming requiring C++.
* **SQL:** Database manipulation with queries, storage and managment of data.
* **Docker:** Containerization with docker and managing them.
* **Rabbitmq:** To make apps and services with Pub/Sub architecture.
* **AWS S3 and Cloudfront:** Using S3 for serverless storage of data and security while Cloudfront as CDN for caching, low latencies and reverse proxy for better protection.

**🛠️ What I'm Building**
I believe in "learning by doing." My repositories are a mix of:
* **The Fun Stuff:** Games, creative coding, and cool experiments.
* **The Necessary Stuff:** Automation scripts and utilities I needed for myself.
* **The Heavy Lifting:** Backend servers, database integrations, and REST APIs.
